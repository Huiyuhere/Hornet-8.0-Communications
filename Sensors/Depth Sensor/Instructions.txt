Install MS5837 library by BlueRobotics on Arduino. (under library manager)

While communicating with Pico, remember to define i2c pins (SDA and SCL). Pin numbers are in terms of GPIO pins.
Connect the JST GH connector or bare wires to the appropriate microcontroller pins, using a logic level converter iftesting with a board that outputs 5V logic:

Green: SCL (3.3V logic)
White: SDA (3.3V logic)
Red: +2.5-5.5V
Black: Ground
